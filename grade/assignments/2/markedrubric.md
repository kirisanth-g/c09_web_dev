# Assignment 2: Rubric

**Important**: This rubric is a guideline for marking and should not be considered as binding. It means that the course staff reserves the right to:

- modify the rubric after the submission deadline
- assign more or less weight to each rubric elements when it comes to give a score

Complete this rubric by filling the blanks and selecting options using an `x` whenever it is appropriate. Here is an example that you should modify as well:

1. My name is [firstname] Kirisanth and this rubric is [select one]:
    - _ missing
    - _ incomplete for the most part
    - _ badly filled for several questions
    - _ good but couple of questions were not filled or wrongly filled
    - x perfect

1. The API design follows the REST principles: [select many]
    - _ all requests do use the appropriate HTTP method
    - _ all URLs do follow the proper collection/element pattern
    - _ all requests do have the appropriate body (when required)
    - _ all requests do have the appropriate content-type header
    - _ all responses do have the appropriate content-type header
    - x all responses do have the appropriate status-code

    In the box below, write down the issues with the API:
    **Comments**
    ```
    None.

    - _ data are stored in memory (global variables)
    - _ data are stored in the database but the database schema does not follow good practices
    - x data is stored in a database and its schema follows good practices

1. Data queries: [select one]
    - _ data queries are missing
    - _ data queries are poor and sometimes retrieve the entire collection in memory
    - _ data queries are satisfying but can be significantly improved (for instance multiple queries can be done in one or queries can be done more precise to avoid retrieving unnecessary data)
    - x data queries are good overall

1. JSON: [select one]
    - _ JSON is not used at all
    - _ JSON is used but not sometimes not appropriately (JSON is not fully understood)
    - _ JSON is used appropriately but sometimes without the appropriate content-type
    - x JSON is used appropriately with the appropriate content-type

1. Uploaded files: [select many]
    - _ uploaded files are uploaded using the appropriate content-type
    - _ uploaded files are stored along with their metadata
    - _ uploaded files are served dynamically using one or several routing methods
    - x uploaded files are served with the correct mime-type

1. Errors: [select one]
    - _ not handled at all
    - _ are sparsely handled
    - _ are correctly handled (the application never crash)
    - x are correctly handled and output the correct status when appropriate

1. The API implementation follows the good practices: [select many]
    - _ the API can serve multiple requests simultaneously (for instance it does not rely on global variables that could create race conditions)
    - x the API works independently from the frontent

1. Overall, when using the API: [select one]
    - _ it does not work because several features are not implemented
    - _ it does not work well as a simple usage does not give the expected results or generates errors
    - _ it works relatively well but a heavy usage does not give the expected results or generates errors
    - x it works really well under all kinds of usages
    - _ it works exceptionally well and tolerates bad usages (security aside): bad user inputs, UI stress and so on
