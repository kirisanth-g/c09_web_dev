- What is a RESTful API?
  - The URL's path is composed with /Collection/Elemen/Element/...
  - e.g GET /message/:limit/ pagination
- What are the main design principles behind REST?
  - Meanings:
    - PUT /messages/
      - Replace the Collection
    - PUT /messages/36/
      - Replace message \#36
      - if \#36 DNE creates message at \#36 (is idempotent)
    - POST /messages/
      - Create a message element
      - id is unknown and should be returned (not idempotent)
    - POST /messages/36/
      - Doesn't make sense, POST requests aren't like this
- When do browsers perform HTTP requests? For each situation, what method is used or can be used?
  - Entering a URL (GET)

  - iFrame (Any)

- Can you read the content of a file stored locally in Javascript executed in the browser? In other words, is it possible to obtain a file handler in Javascript? If so, how?
  - No, the user must give a file handler via form element or drag & drop
- How are uploaded files sent to the server? What is the best body encoding for that purpose? Why?
  - Multipart - Best use as it support compression
  - JSON
- What is a mimetype? Why is it useful?
